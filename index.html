<p>  <em>N.C. A&T JUNIOR JOINS UNIVERSITY INNOVATION FELLOWS</em></br></br>
Junior, computer science major Angelica Willis is the first North Carolina A&T State University student to be named to the National Center for Engineering Pathways to Innovation's (Epicenter) University Innovation Fellows program.
</br></br>
Willis is one of 150 student from 52 colleges and universities in the United States to be chosen for this national program designed to empower student leaders to increase campus engagement with innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity and design thinking. This program is operated by Epicenter, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and directed by Stanford University and VentureWell.
</br></br>
Fellows design innovation spaces, start entrepreneurship organizations, host experiential learning events and work with faculty to develop new courses.
</br></br>
To do this, Willis has identified two strategic priorities: Provide a growth factor for student innovation; and promote student interdisciplinary exploration of entrepreneurship. Within these two priorities, seven projects have been identified.</p>
