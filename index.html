https://youtu.be/NRON8pCywd4k The world currently uses more environmental resources than it produces ina given year. Sometimes measures of environmental impact do not tell the true story. The goal of my project is to use a robust linear regression model with a  gaussian prior to understand environmental impact in terms of land use (forest land, farming), population, GDP, carbon footprint, and ecological footprint, to create a visualization of outlier counties that can be celebrated as positive examples, or held accountable as negative examples of environmental stewardship.
